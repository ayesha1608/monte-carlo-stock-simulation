Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulation 

This project uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate possible future stock prices for Amazon and Aramco over a 1-year period using historical stock price data and Python.

Project Description

Monte Carlo simulations are widely used in finance to forecast the probability of different outcomes when the intervention of random variables is present. This project simulates 1000 possible price paths for each company and analyzes the distribution of their future stock prices.

Key Concepts
	⁃	Monte Carlo Simulation  
	⁃	Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)  
	⁃	Historical Stock Data  
	⁃	Visualization with Matplotlib  
	⁃	Exporting to CSV  
	⁃	Confidence Intervals and Statistical Summary  

Tools & Libraries Used
	⁃	Python 
	⁃	NumPy
	⁃	Pandas
	⁃	 Matplotlib
	⁃	 Jupyter Notebook

Files Included
	⁃	simulation.ipynb – Jupyter notebook containing all code, simulations, and visualizations.
	⁃	simulation_results.csv – CSV file with the final simulated prices for Amazon and Aramco.
	⁃	monte_carlo_histogram.png – Histogram comparing the final price distributions of both companies.
	⁃	README.md – Project overview, methodology explanation, and usage instructions.

Results & Insights
Histogram: Shows the spread of final stock prices after 1 year.
Confidence Intervals help estimate the risk/volatility in each stock.
Mean & Standard Deviation: Indicates likely price ranges and uncertainty.

 How to Run
	1.	Clone the repo or download the ZIP
	2.	Open `simulation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
	3.	Run all cells to generate results
	4.	Use the CSV and PNG output for further analysis (e.g., in Excel or Power BI)

Future Improvements
	⁃	Automate data download via API (e.g., Yahoo Finance) 
	⁃	Extend to more companies
	⁃	Add options pricing simulation
	⁃	Visualize interactive plots using Plotly
